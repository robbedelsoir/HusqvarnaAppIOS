        "description": "Small in capacity while big on capability, the 2023 TC 125 receives multiple technical upgrades, headlined by the inclusion of EFI and E-Start technology. These revisions are instantly noticeable as after a simple push of a button, the engine starts easily, and, once out on track, the TC 125 delivers an unmatched experience. Further changes include a new cylinder with a highly innovative electronic exhaust control system, and a lighter crank for improved throttle response and reduced vibration. Continuing to benefit from class-leading components including WP Suspension, a ProTaper handlebar, and a polyamide-reinforced subframe, the TC 125 receives all-new bodywork and a striking new look to remain at the forefront of the highly competitive 125cc class.",
